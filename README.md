#Text Editor (unamed)
Text-editor (Unamed) is an open source project recovering all the knowledge that i have been adquire during all my estance at Holberton School, the features added to this project are not defined
yet, but the final purpose of this excercise is to build an all custom tool that allow us to make more better tools.

You are totally invited to contribute in this repo.


##Compiling

>**./comp**  *output: [a]

will take all c files in the directory.

##Usage

>**./a [ filename ]**

if no filename is defined, default will be "new_file.myown" this strange format allow us to check easier the result from saving behavior, i recomend to run the following command in order to make more recognizible the output file, run:
 
>**LS_COLORS="${LS_COLORS}*.myown=00;33:"** *33 for yellow*

more color codes

>31: red\n
